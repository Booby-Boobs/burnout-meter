## What is this?

**The Burnout Meter** is a desktop application for macOS and Windows that monitors your keystrokes and mouse movements to scientifically calculate your "HP" (Hit Points).

As you work, your HP drains. When it hits zero, you are legally* allowed to go home.
*(*Not legally binding in any known jurisdiction, but it should be.)*

> **"White-collar work is manual labor."**
> Society says we just "sit at desks." Wrong. We run marathons with our fingers. We drift miles with our mouse. This app visualizes that invisible fatigue.

## How It Works

### 1. Total Surveillance

The app sithe bottom of your screen (or wherever you drag it). It watches every move.

* **Keystrokes:** Each keypress deals damage to your soul.
* **Mouse Distance:** Every pixel traveled is energy lost.

### 2. The HP System

You start the day with **100% HP**.
The algorithm converts your productivity directly into damage. The harder you work, the faster you die (digitally).

* **Green Zone:** You are safe (Slacking off).
* **Red Zone:** Danger. You are being "productive."

### 3. Dr. Lazy’s Cure

Did you hit **0% HP**? Congratulations.
The app instantly generates an **"Official Leave Permit"** signed by Dr. Lazy, PhD in Napping. Print it out. Slam it on your boss's desk. Walk away.
